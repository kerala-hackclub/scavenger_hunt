THE WEB WEAVER'S PUZZLE
I weave connections, thread by thread,
Where requests and responses are bred.
Find the endpoint that returns JSON sweet,
But only if your request is complete.

Hint: The spider's path is /api/weaver.

Solution:
So you sen a request then if you dont have the right headers you get this:
{
  "error": "Missing required headers",
  "hint": "Try including X-Oracle-Key with a value that represents knowledge"
}
Then it returns 
{
  "message": "You have found the knowledge within!",
  "flag": "{api_weaver_master}"
}

Answer: api_weaver_master 
Points: 3
