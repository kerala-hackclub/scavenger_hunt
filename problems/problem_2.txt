Problem: 
THE MINOTAUR'S LABYRINTH
Strength will fail you in the maze of the beast,
But cunning eyes can find the hidden path.
Sometimes victory comes from changing the rules, not following them.

Seek the game where the bull awaits, and conquer it with wisdom, not force.

Solution: 
Minotaur cannot be beaten as it has greater speed than the player. Use inspect and set minotaur_speed to 0 and get 
FLAG{cunning_over_brute_force}
 
Answer: cunning_over_brute_force 
Points: 2
